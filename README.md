#Assignment 2 (Part I) - Action Client and Service Node for Robot Navigation
##Overview
This project involves creating a ROS package named assignment_2 that implements two key components to move the robot by setting a goal to reach. These components are:

###'1.Action Client Node (node1)': an action client that allows the user to set a goal or cancel it, and publishes, on the /robot_information topic, the custom message Robot_info composed of the following fields:
float64 x
float64 y
float64 vel_x
float64 vel_z
###'Service Node (node2)': a service that returns the coordinates of the last goal set by the user through the first node.
##Nodes Description
###1. Action Client Node
Everything is managed in the same terminal tab where the launch file was started. The action client will prompt you to press one of three keys:

s to set a new goal
c to cancel an active goal
q to exit the program
If s is pressed, you will also need to enter the x and y coordinates of the robot's destination.

After setting the goal, once the robot reaches it, a warning will be printed containing the robot's current position and the goal status, which will be: Goal reached!. Additionally, this node publishes the robot's position and velocity as a custom message containing x, y, vel_x, vel_z, using the /odom topic data.

###2. Service Node
This node is a service that allows retrieving the last goal set to the action server. The functionality is simple, no specific request is needed, and the service response will simply be the last goal set of type geometry_msgs/PoseStamped.

###3. Launch File
The simulation.launch file initializes the action client, service nodes, and all simulation nodes included in the assignment_2_2024 package. The launch file opens a new gnome-terminal to execute the action client, allowing the user to interact more effectively with the node.

##Install the Package
Prerequisites
ROS must be installed on your system
A properly configured ROS workspace
Gazebo and RViz installed
Clone the package assignment_2_2024 at the following link: assignment_2_2024
##1. Clone the Package
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the src folder of your ROS workspace:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
Clone the assignment_2 package repository:
git clone https://github.com/ta04lha/assignment_2.git
Enter the repo and switch to the main branch:
cd assignment_2
git switch main
##2. Compile the Package
Navigate back to the main workspace directory:
cd ~/catkin_ws
Compile the package using catkin_make:
catkin_make
Check that the package compiled successfully. If there are no errors, a build completion message will appear.
##3. Source the Environment
Update the ROS environment variables to make your package accessible by adding the following line inside your ~/.bashrc file:
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
To apply the changes, type the command:
source ~/.bashrc
##4. Run the Package
####4.1. Start the Simulation from launch file
Open the terminal and run the whole simulation
roslaunch assignment_2 simulation.launch
A second terminal will be opened, allowing the user to interact to set or cancel the goal.
####4.2 (Optional) Call to the service node
If you want to make a call to the service node to get the last goal that was sent to the action server, you need to open a new terminal tab and type the command:
rosservice call /get_last_goal
and you will receive a message of type geometry_msgs/PoseStamped containing the last set goal.
##5. Interacting with the Nodes
Action Client Node: everything is managed in the same terminal tab where the launch file was started. The action client will prompt you to press one of three keys:

s to set a new goal
c to cancel an active goal
q to exit the program
#####Don't worry about the messages being printed, the action client will always be listening!.

##.Service Node:
 To interact with it, just open a new terminal and use the command rosservice call /get_last_goal.
